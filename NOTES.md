# Assumptions

* Assume the model will not be used against the carpet background.
* Seems a tad easy otherwise, looking for some generalisability.

# The Plan
* First train a classifier on my laptop with it at first overfitting probably, but check we can get loss to decrease.
* Repeat the above performing cross validation.
* Repeat the above with only the generation dataset augmented.
* See how bad we're doing and experiment with some augmentations.
